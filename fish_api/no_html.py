#"Research": "<ul>\n<li>Ocean acidification:\n<ul>\n<li>Acidification causes a number of changes in water chemistry that may be stressful to estuarine organisms.</li>\n<li>In 2015, the Puget Sound Restoration Fund, NOAA, and other partners received $1.5 million from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation to tackle the impacts of ocean acidification using sugar kelp.</li>\n<li>Growth and Genetics:</li>\n<li>The Northeast Fisheries Science Center’s Milford Lab is studying different aspects of sugar kelp to help commercial growers expand their operations.</li>\n<li>In early 2017, researchers tested the lab’s sorting flow cytometer. The instrument will allow high-volume screening of individual kelp plants for desired traits such as high-temperature tolerance. This method may be used in the future for improving sugar kelp strains.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Human Health:\n<ul>\n<li>Milford Lab scientists, through a grant from the NOAA Aquaculture Program, are also studying different kinds of organisms like bacteria, micro-and macro-algae that may be growing on the surface of sugar kelp at different stages of the kelp’s growth. They isolated Vibrio bacteria from the plant to see how abundance changes throughout the growing season. They have found that Vibrio is absent during most of the growing season since this bacteria prefers warmer waters. This information can help growers harvest in the best possible conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Energy:\n<ul>\n<li>One of the Milford Lab’s sugar kelp collaborators also received $5.7 million in 2017 from the Department of Energy through the agency’s program focused on advancing seaweed energy production, Macroalgae Research Inspiring Novel Energy Resources (MARINER). The grant to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will fund a selective breeding program for sugar kelp and an autonomous underwater observation system to advance the mass production of seaweed for biofuels and bio-based chemicals.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"
